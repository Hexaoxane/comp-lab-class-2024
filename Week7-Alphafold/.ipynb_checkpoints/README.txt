Week 7 Assignment Summary
This week's assignment focuses on the analysis of protein structures using AlphaFold predictions, VMD visualizations, and MDTraj calculations. Below is a summary of the generated outputs and corresponding analyses:

1. Arp-Est VMD Visualization (arp_est_vmd_visualization_windowed.png)
This image represents the visualization of the Arp-Est protein structure using VMD. The different predicted models were aligned and visualized, showcasing structural variations among the predicted ensembles.
2. Arp-Est RMSF Analysis (arp_est_rmsf.png)
This plot shows the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) analysis for the Arp-Est protein ensemble. RMSF was calculated to determine the flexibility of residues, highlighting dynamic regions, with the most flexible regions observed towards the C-terminal end.
3. Actin AF2-AF3 Residue Distance Analysis (actin_af2_af3_residue_distances.png)
The image displays the residue-level distance comparison between the AF2 and AF3 predictions of the Actin protein. Significant distance variations indicate regions where the predictions from the two models differ most, likely due to structural flexibility or different modeling techniques.
4. Actin-Profilin ATP/ADP Overlap (Advanced) (actin_profilin_atp_adp_overlay_advanced.png)
This advanced visualization compares the ATP-bound and ADP-bound forms of the Actin-Profilin complex, showing the structural differences in these states. The surface rendering emphasizes key regions of structural divergence upon ATP hydrolysis.
5. Actin-Profilin AF2-AF3 Alignment (actin_profilin_af2_af3_alignment_spheres.png)
This image represents the structural alignment between the AF2 and AF3 predicted models of the Actin-Profilin complex, visualized using a spheres representation to highlight residue-by-residue alignment differences.
6. Actin-Profilin ATP/ADP Overlap (Spheres) (actin_profilin_atp_adp_overlay_spheres.png)
This visualization compares the Actin-Profilin complex in the ATP-bound and ADP-bound states, displayed in a spheres model. The structural changes during ATP to ADP conversion are evident in specific regions of the complex.
7. NSP13 plDDT Dynamic Visualization (NSP13_plDDT_dynamic_colored_relative_4k.png)
This image presents the plDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) dynamic visualization for the SARS-CoV-2 Helicase NSP13 protein. Residues are colored according to their predicted confidence levels, providing insights into the reliability of the AlphaFold predictions.
8. NSP13 Prediction Visualization (nsp13_prediction_visualization.png)
This visualization shows the overall predicted structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Helicase NSP13 using AlphaFold. The image highlights the tertiary structure, showcasing domains relevant for its biological function.
