2JOF_clean.pdb
    Cleaned PDB file with water molecules removed. This file contains the atomic coordinates of the protein after removing unnecessary solvent molecules.
2JOF.pdb
    Original PDB file before any modification. Contains the full atomic coordinates of the protein and potentially other molecules (like water).
2JOF_processed.gro
    Processed GRO file after applying pdb2gmx. It contains the atom coordinates of the protein after generating the topology and adding hydrogens.
ions.mdp
    GROMACS parameter file for adding ions to neutralize the system. It specifies parameters related to the ion placement.
ions.tpr
    Portable binary run input file created by grompp, specifying the system's parameters for ion addition. This is used for energy minimization or equilibration.
md.mdp
    Parameter file used for the production molecular dynamics (MD) run, typically specifying time steps, temperature, pressure coupling, and other simulation parameters.
mdout.mdp
    A default output file generated by GROMACS, containing all the parameters used in a simulation after processing with grompp.
minim.mdp
    Input parameter file for energy minimization. It defines how the system's potential energy is minimized before equilibration.
npt.mdp
    nput file for the NPT (constant pressure and temperature) equilibration step. It includes pressure coupling parameters (e.g., Parrinello-Rahman barostat).
nvt.mdp
    Input file for the NVT (constant volume and temperature) equilibration step, with temperature coupling parameters (e.g., V-rescale thermostat).
posre.itp
    Position restraint file used to restrain certain atoms (e.g., protein heavy atoms) during equilibration. This ensures the system can relax while the protein stays fixed.
topol.top
    Topology file generated by pdb2gmx, containing molecular descriptions, force field parameters, and system information (e.g., bonds, angles, atom types).
submit_gromacs.sh
    Shell script used for submitting the GROMACS job to a high-performance computing cluster, defining resources such as CPU, memory, and job parameters.
trp_cage_box.gro
    GRO file specifying the protein and its simulation box. This file includes the box dimensions and the position of all atoms before solvation.
trp_cage_solvated.gro
    GRO file after solvation, where the protein is surrounded by water molecules. Used for the subsequent energy minimization and equilibration steps.
trp_cage_solvated_ions.gro
    GRO file after ion addition, where the protein is in water, and ions have been added to neutralize the system.
