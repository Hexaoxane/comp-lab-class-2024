1. Potential energy surface difference.ipynb:
   - This notebook compares the potential energy surfaces (PES) between different temperatures (300K, 400K, and 600K). It calculates and visualizes the differences in PES, highlighting regions where the energy landscapes vary. The visualizations use color gradients to indicate the magnitude of differences, making it easier to identify temperature-dependent conformational changes.

2. Potential.ipynb:
   - This notebook analyzes the potential energy of the system at different temperatures using the GROMACS output files. It plots energy histograms and overlaps them for different replicas, showing the overlap and convergence of energy distributions. This helps evaluate the effectiveness of the parallel tempering (REMD) simulation and how well the replicas exchange states.

3. Temperature.ipynb:
   - This notebook processes and visualizes temperature fluctuations for each replica over time. It uses the `replica_temp.xvg` file generated by the demux script to show how replicas move between temperatures during the REMD simulation. The plots provide insights into how frequently exchanges occur and whether the temperature ranges are adequately sampled.

4. dihedral angle.ipynb:
   - This notebook computes and visualizes the dihedral angles (phi and psi) of the alanine dipeptide. It shows time-series plots of the dihedral angles, helping to identify the conformational behavior of the peptide. The notebook provides a detailed view of the system's dynamics over the course of the simulation, useful for understanding its structural transitions.

5. Potential_Energy_Surface.ipynb:
   - This notebook creates a free energy surface (FES) based on the computed phi and psi dihedral angles from the trajectory data. It visualizes the FES as a 2D heatmap with a color bar representing energy levels, highlighting regions of low and high free energy. This allows for analysis of the conformational space explored at different temperatures and identification of stable states.

6. replica_temp.ipynb:
   - This notebook specifically handles the analysis of the replica exchange data (`replica_temp.xvg`). It plots how each replica's temperature changes over time, showing whether replicas are effectively swapping temperatures and providing insight into the efficiency of the REMD simulation. The visual output helps confirm if the replicas are exploring the temperature space as intended.

7. Parallel dihedral angles.ipynb:
   - This notebook computes and compares dihedral angles (phi and psi) across different replicas and temperatures in parallel. It plots these angles for each temperature, illustrating how the conformational space varies with temperature changes. The notebook is instrumental in analyzing how temperature impacts the structural dynamics of the system.

8. PARALLEL potential surface.ipynb:
   - This notebook generates and compares the potential energy surfaces (PES) for all temperatures (300K, 400K, and 600K) in parallel. It uses data from all replicas to create visual representations of the energy landscapes and compares them side by side. It helps in understanding how temperature influences the stability and distribution of energy states in the system.
