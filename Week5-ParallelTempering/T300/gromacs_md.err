Back Off! I just backed up adp.log to ./#adp.log.1#
Compiled SIMD is AVX2_256, but CPU also supports AVX_512 (see log).
Reading file adp.tpr, VERSION 2023.3 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 8 MPI processes

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'Protein'
7500000 steps,  15000.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 10.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 16%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.7%.
